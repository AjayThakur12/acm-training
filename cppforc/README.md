ACM/ICPC SELF TRAINING --- C++ for C Programmers
============

This folder contains all my practices from the course named _C++ for C Programmers_.

##SOME NEW FACTS TO ME (WEEK 1)##

1. Int is more precisely than Float type. Usually, machine can represent +/- 2 billion integers, but only can represent at most 6 significant bit for Float type.
2. `srand()` initialises random number sequence.
3. `static_cast<double>`, a more safer conversion of types than `(double)` [SAFE CAST].
4. `endl` is not `\n`, it is a iomanipulator.
5. Reasons why C++ is better than C: (1) More libraries (2) Type safe (3) Less reliance on preprocessor (4) OO vs imperative.
6. DEFINE is textually substitution, should be avoided.
7. `inline void swap(int& i, int& j)`
8. "signature matching algorithm": can use same function name in different declaration.
9. "Generics": programming in templates.
