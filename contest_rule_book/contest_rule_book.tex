\section{Score}

Score of a particular contest depends on participant's performance. Only top 20 participants are awarded scores. Participant $p$'s scores is calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
	\text{score}_{p}=20-\text{rank}_{p}+1
\end{equation*}
If the contest has $n<10$ participants, then the score is calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
	\text{score}_{p}=n-\text{rank}_{p}+1
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Master Score is calculated based on records of Golden and Season league.
	\item Coder Score is calculated based on records of Silver league.
	\item Apprentice is calculated based on records of Elementary and Bronze league.
	\item \emph{ACM/ICPC Team Selection League is not considered for score calculation}.
