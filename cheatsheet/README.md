##Introduction

This cheat sheet is fully written in C++ or pseudo-code. The entire cheat sheet is organised by LaTeX scripts, you can download and modify it.

Currently the contents include
+ STL Useful Tips: introduced handy functions you can use in competition.
+ Number Theory: algorithms that deal with numbers.
+ Searching Algorithms: some useful searching suggestions.
+ Dynamic Programming: includes typical types of Dynamic Programming problems.
+ Trees: contains batch of handy suggestions and implementation notes
+ Graph Theory: useful and famous graph algorithms
